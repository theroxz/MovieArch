# Project MovieArch

This project is developed by using react, tailwind and other packages. It is an app for users to create a movie archive, you can see the running version from here: [projectmoviearch.netlify.app](https://projectmoviearch.netlify.app/) But I want to inform that there isn't any backend for this project. So it doesn't properly run. I recommend you to run this project on your local.

## How to Run on Your Local

After you clone this repository to your local computer,

Open the project directory and run these commands:

### `npx start json-server "./src/api/movies.json" --port 3001`

This is necessary for this project to run in your local.

It opens a fake api in your port 3001
Open [http://localhost:3001/movies](http://localhost:3001/movies) to view it in your browser.

You can see the data on this link after you execute the command.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
